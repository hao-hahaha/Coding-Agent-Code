Agent with Agent as Tool Example

This example demonstrates how to use an agent as a tool for another agent.
It shows how to create a research agent that can be used as a tool by a blog writer agent.

Run with:
    uv run 08_agent_with_agent_as_tool.py --prompt "Write a blog post about quantum computing"

Test with:
    uv run pytest 08_agent_with_agent_as_tool.py
